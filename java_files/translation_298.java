Create a function to calculate the sum of all elements in a given 2D array. The function should take the 2D array as input and return the sum of all its elements. You can assume that the 2D array is rectangular (i.e., all rows have the same length). Here's an example input: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] And here's the corresponding output: 45 Explanation: The sum of all elements in the given 2D array is 45. This can be calculated by iterating over each row and column, adding up all the values. In this case, the function `calculateSum` takes the 2D array as input and returns the sum of all its elements. The `assert` statement checks that the input array has at least one element, and the function handles empty arrays gracefully by returning 0.
