Create a new class called "BookSheetKey" that consists of bookIndex, sheetIndex, and lastSheetIndex properties. The bookIndex property should be an int representing the zero-based index of the book in which the sheet resides. The sheetIndex property should also be an int representing the zero-based index of the sheet within the book. The lastSheetIndex property is an optional int that represents the zero-based index of the last sheet in the book. If it is not provided, it should default to -1. Your solution should be idiomatic in the target language, and output only the translated codeâ€”no explanations.
