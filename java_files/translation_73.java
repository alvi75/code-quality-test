Create a new class called "BookSheetKey" that consists of bookIndex, sheetIndex, and lastSheetIndex. Implement a constructor for this class that takes in bookIndex, sheetIndex, and lastSheetIndex as parameters. Also, override the equals method to compare two BookSheetKeys for equality based on their bookIndex, sheetIndex, and lastSheetIndex fields.
