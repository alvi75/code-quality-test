        it was not clear from your description how you want to handle EOF. If you don't expect to read enough data to fill the buffer, you should check if there is any remaining data after reading the required amount. Here's an updated version of the code that includes this check:public ByteBuffer read(int length, long position) throws IOException {
            if (position >= size()) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Position " + position + " past the end of the stream");
            }
            ByteBuffer dst;
            int worked = -1;
            if (writable) {
                dst = ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(length);
                worked = 0;
            }
            else {
                dst = ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(length);
                worked = in.read(dst.buffer());
            }
            if (worked == -1) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Position " + position + " past the end of the stream");
            }
            dst.position(0);
            return dst;
        }
}
