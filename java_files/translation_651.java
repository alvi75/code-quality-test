Create a new class called "BookSheetKey" that contains bookIndex, sheetIndex, and lastSheetIndex as properties. Implement a constructor that initializes these properties, and override the "Equals" method to compare two BookSheetKeys for equality based on their bookIndex, sheetIndex, and lastSheetIndex properties.
