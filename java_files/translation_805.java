Create a function to calculate the sum of all elements in a given 2D array. The function should take the 2D array as input and return the sum of all its elements. You can assume that the 2D array is rectangular (i.e., all rows have the same length) and that it contains only numeric values (e.g., integers or floats). Here's an example input and output: Input: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]] Output: 45 Explanation: The sum of all elements in the 2D array is 45, which is the result of adding up all the individual elements in each row and column. Note: You can assume that the input 2D array will always be valid (i.e., non-null and rectangular), and that it will not contain any duplicate values.
