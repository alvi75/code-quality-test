Create a new class called "BookSheetKey" that consists of bookIndex, sheetIndex, and lastSheetIndex fields. Implement a constructor for this class that takes in bookIndex, sheetIndex, and lastSheetIndex parameters, and assigns them to the respective fields. Also, override the equals() method to compare two BookSheetKeys for equality based on their bookIndex, sheetIndex, and lastSheetIndex fields.
